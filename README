Linux-Distribution version 0.20
===============================

This is a simple module that tries to guess on what linux distribution we are running by looking
for release's files in /etc.  It now looks for 'lsb-release' first as that should be the most cor-
rect and adds ubuntu support.  Secondly, it will look for the distro specific files.

It currently recognizes slackware, debian, suse, fedora, redhat, turbolinux, yellowdog, knoppix,
mandrake, conectiva, immunix, tinysofa, va-linux, trustix, adamantix, yoper, arch-linux, libranet,
gentoo, ubuntu and redflag.

It has function to get the version for debian, suse, fedora, redhat, gentoo, slackware, redflag and
ubuntu(lsb). People running unsupported distro's are greatly encouraged to submit patches :-)
